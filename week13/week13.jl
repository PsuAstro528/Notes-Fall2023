### Tests
**Q:**
Can you explain again what integration and regression tests are and the difference between them?

**A:** 

- **Unit tests**:  Tests one specific piece of code, usually small and well-defined behavior.  Aim for each function that actually does a calculation to have _at least_ one unit test.  

- **Integration tests**:  Tests how two (or more) pieces of code (e.g., functions, packages) interact.  E.g., Calling one function with outputs of another function, reading outputs of code as inputs to another code.  Aim to test each handoff of data from one stage of your analysis to the next.
   Common errors that can be easily detected with integration tests:  
    - Variable/structure types
    - Names of variables, columns, arguements
    - Units
    - Which array index is for what dimension
    - Order of variables (if using order rather than names)
    - Changes to parameters required/accepted by function

- **End-to-end tests**:  Tests code from beginning to final result.  Might test for limiting cases where behavior can be predicted analytically.  Might test for more typical values by comparing to another result.  Very often implemented as a regression test.  

- **Regression tests**:  Tests whether the outputs match expectations.  Can apply to unit-tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.  Often checking that results don't change (significantly) compared to a previous version of the code.

### What goes into Julia.Base?
**Q:** Some packages are extremely useful and I'm surprised I have to add them. What does it take for packages to get integrated into the default Julia environment?

**A:** 
Julia developers discuss and decide what to include.  Policy is that new features that would directly affect users (e.g., incorporating a package into Base) should only happen in major (e.g., v1.0, v2.0,...) or minor releases (e.g., 1.6.0, 1.7.0).  Recently, developers have aimed for minor release roughly twice a year.  

Julia is open-source, so anyone can create their own fork of Julia that includes more packages by default.  Why haven't they?  
- It's easy to add packages, so not worth the effort.
- People value having development effort concentrated in one version.
- People are sufficiently satisfied (or at least not very dissatisfied) with how it's been handled.

What do maintainers look for (not official, just my guesses):
- Generally applicable as opposed to highly specialized.
- Mature implementation that works well and isn't changing.
- Mature API that is unlikely to need changes soon.
- Integrates well with existing types and functions in Julia Base.
- Quality tests and good coverage.
- Sufficient documentation.
- Practical plan for maintaing code.

### Multi-threading vs Multi-processing
**Q:** What is the difference between multithreaded programming and multiprocessing?

**A:**
1. Shared/Separate memory spaces: 
   - Threads share access to a common memory space
   - Processes are each allocated their own memory space
2.  Potential for conflicts
   - Threads use locks to prevent avoid memory conflicts
   - Each process can write to its own memory without checking if anyone else is using it. 
3.  Ability to scale up
   - Multithreading only works on shared-memory systems
   - Multiprocessing can work on either shared or distributed-memory systems

   - ``At a minimum the Data Management Plan (DMP) for ROSES must explain how you will release the data needed to reproduce figures, tables and other representations in publications, at the time of publication. Providing this data via supplementary materials with the journal is one really easy way to do this and it has the advantage that the data and the figures are linked together in perpetuity without any ongoing effort on your part.'' and
   - ``Software, whether a stand-alone program, an enhancement to existing code, or a module that interfaces with existing codes, created as part of a ROSES award, should be made publicly available when it is practical and feasible to do so, and when there is scientific utility in doing so... SMD expects that the source code, with associated documentation sufficient to enable use of the code, will be made publicly available as Open Source Software (OSS) under an appropriately permissive license (e.g., Apache-2, BSD-3-Clause, GPL). This includes all software developed with SMD funding used in the production of data products, as well as software developed to discover, access, visualize, and transform NASA data.'' -- [NASA SARA DMP FAQ](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/dmp-faq-roses)

## Environments
Environment llow you to have multiple versions of packages installed and rapidly specify which versions you want made avaliable for the current session.  In Julia, 
- Project.toml:  Specifies direct dependencies & version constaints (required)

- Manifest.toml:  Specifies precise version of direct & indirect dependancies, so as to offer a fully reproducible environment (optional)

- If no Manifest.toml, then package manager can find most recent versions that satisfy Project.toml requirements.

`julia`
starts julia with default environment (separate environment for each minor version number, e.g., 1.6)

`julia --project=.` or `julia --project` starts julia using environment specified by Project.toml and Manifest.toml in current directory (if don't exist, will create them).

### Register your package
**Q:** How can a package be added to a registry? Say I were to write a new package, that I want to release into the world-how would I "add it to a registry?"

**A:** [Registrator.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl)

!["amelia robot logo"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/master/graphics/logo.png)

Registrator is a GitHub app that automates creation of registration pull requests for your julia packages to the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry. Install the app below!

## Install Registrator:

[![install](https://img.shields.io/badge/-install%20app-blue.svg)](https://github.com/apps/juliateam-registrator/installations/new)

Click on the "install" button above to add the registration bot to your repository

## How to Use

There are two ways to use Registrator: a web interface and a GitHub app.

### Via the Web Interface

This workflow supports repositories hosted on either GitHub or GitLab.

Go to https://juliahub.com and log in using your GitHub or GitLab account. Then click on "Register packages" on the left menu.
There are also more detailed instructions [here](https://juliaregistries.github.io/Registrator.jl/stable/webui/#Usage-(For-Package-Maintainers)-1).

### Via the GitHub App

Unsurprisingly, this method only works for packages whose repositories are hosted on GitHub.

The procedure for registering a new package is the same as for releasing a new version.  

If the registration bot is not added to the repository, `@JuliaRegistrator register` will not result in package registration.

1. Click on the "install" button above to add the registration bot to your repository
2. Set the [`(Julia)Project.toml`](Project.toml) version field in your repository to your new desired `version`.
3. Comment `@JuliaRegistrator register` on the commit/branch you want to register (e.g. like [here](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/issues/61#issuecomment-483486641) or [here](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl/commit/3c3a92610ebc8885619f561fe988b0d985852fce#commitcomment-33233149)).
4. If something is incorrect, adjust, and redo step 2.
5. If the automatic tests pass, but a moderator makes suggestions (e.g., manually updating your `(Julia)Project.toml` to include a [compat] section with version requirements for dependencies), then incorporate suggestions as you see fit into a new commit, and redo step 2 _for the new commit_.  You don't need to do anything to close out the old request.
6. Finally, either rely on the [TagBot GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/julia-tagbot) to tag and make a github release or alternatively tag the release manually.

Registrator will look for the project file in the master branch by default, and will use the version set in the `(Julia)Project.toml` file via, for example, `version = "0.1.0"`. To use a custom branch comment with:

```
@JuliaRegistrator register branch=name-of-your-branch
```

```
@JuliaRegistrator register

**Q:** Is developing a package something that we will likely do many times in the future if we are writing new code for our projects? Or is it only something we would use if we are writing code that we want lots of other researchers to be able to use?

**A:**
It depends:
- Code for running the simulations in a paper (or series of closely related papers):  Likely a package, perhaps more than one.
- Code for all figures in a paper:  Likely a git repo, but probably not a package. 
- Code for one figure:  Not a package.  Likely a script or directory of files in a git repo.
